## Application Load Balancer

In AWS, ALB stands for Application Load Balancer. It is a service that provides high availability and automatic scaling for your applications. ALB operates at the application layer (Layer 7) of the OSI model and can distribute incoming traffic to multiple targets, such as EC2 instances, containers, or Lambda functions, within a region.

ALB is a powerful service that helps improve the availability, scalability, and fault tolerance of your applications. It plays a crucial role in distributing traffic efficiently across multiple targets and simplifies the management of your infrastructure.

In this post we are going to see canary deployment vs blue green deployment of the applications.
